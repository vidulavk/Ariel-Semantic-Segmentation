This repository showcases a semantic segmentation project using the Semantic Drone Dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes high-resolution images captured by drones, annotated for semantic segmentation tasks. The goal of this project is to develop a robust semantic segmentation model to identify and classify objects in drone-captured images.

Semantic segmentation is a critical computer vision task, especially in the context of drone imagery analysis. This project leverages the Semantic Drone Dataset to build and train a semantic segmentation model using PyTorch. The code is organized to facilitate understanding and modification, making it a valuable resource for both learning and practical applications.

USAGE:
1.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-segmentation-pytorch.git
cd semantic-segmentation-pytorch
2.Install dependencies
3.Train the model
4.Evaluate the model

The model architecture is defined in model.py. It includes essential components for semantic segmentation, and you can customize it based on your specific needs.

After training, the model's performance can be assessed using the evaluation script. The README in the original article provides a detailed explanation of how to interpret the results and adjust parameters for optimal performance.

Contributions to enhance and extend this PyTorch-based semantic segmentation project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. The project follows the guidelines outlined in the original article.

The implementation in this repository is based on the article "Train Neural Net for Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch in 50 Lines of Code", providing valuable insights into building an effective semantic segmentation model with PyTorch.
